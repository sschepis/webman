        "text": "WASHINGTON â€” Even in a Congress where bipartisanship and comity are now officially the exceptions to the regular order, the near implosion on Capitol Hill on Thursday was notable, as both chambers erupted in a furor that went on for much of the day.        \n  \n   Democrats Poised to Limit Filibusters, Angering G.O.P. (July 12, 2013) \n \n    In the Senate, leaders fought bitterly over proposed changes to Senate rules that would limit the filibuster, with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, trading barbs with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, several times on the Senate floor.        \n â€œThese are dark days in the history of the Senate,â€ Mr. McConnell said ominously, adding that the rule change suggested by Mr. Reid would lead to the Democratâ€™s being remembered as â€œthe worst leader of the Senate ever.â€ The two men, both crafty lawmakers and once seemingly friends, seem now barely able to countenance each otherâ€™s presence.        \n Over in the House, Republicans â€” without the help of a single Democrat â€” passed perhaps the most partisan farm bill in recent history, stripping out the food stamp program to attract enough support from conservatives. Just passing the bill, which was prepared in the House Rules Committee in the dark of night on Wednesday, proved an unusual chore as furious Democrats pulled one procedural move after another to delay the inevitable, taking turns to disparage the bill from the floor.        \n â€œI am not proud of what youâ€™re seeing here today,â€ said Representative Tim Walz, Democrat of Minnesota. â€œThe disrespect shown to this hallowed ground by hatching this abomination in the middle of the night and forcing it here because of this extremist element is the reason that the American people think higher of North Korea than they do of this body.â€        \n The chaos reflects the reality that Congress has largely been reduced from a lawmaking entity to a political operation, in which positions are taken and fermented largely in the name of maintaining party unity rather than attracting votes from the other side. In the House, under the rule of Republicans, the minority is largely powerless to do anything but protest. Senate Republicans at least have the power to filibuster, which helps explain why they are so adamantly opposed to the Democratsâ€™ gambit.        \n Some Senate Republicans, after years of asking the majority to pass a budget, now refuse to allow the House and Senate to reconcile their two versions, less because of policy disagreements and more, it would appear, to appeal to a base that simply abhors deal-making. For their part, Democrats had been enjoying a stalemate over the issue of student loans because of its potential for campaign advertising copy next year.        \n Bills come together now more often because of a breakdown in party unity, as was the case this week with the student loan bill, when Democrats showed signs of yielding because of disagreements within their own party over how to proceed. Likewise, Republicans occasionally will adopt Senate solutions only when their party is divided over their own bills, as was the case this year when they were forced to swallow a fiscal deal that included tax increases on high earners.        \n The exception to the misery remains, at least largely, in the Appropriations Committees, owing perhaps to its now-waning tradition of benevolence as lawmakers take care of one anotherâ€™s needs. Even as bills passed through the Senate committee on Thursday largely along party lines, laughter filled the hearing room as members joked with the amiable chairwoman of the committee, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland.        \n â€œIllinois is now so tooted,â€ she noted as Senator Mark S. Kirk, a Republican, asked to toot his stateâ€™s horn in recognition of its role in creating an AIDS drug.        \n The divide in Congress stems largely from deep disagreements â€œover the role and scope of government,â€ said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, prompted by the 2010 Republican wave that filled the House with lawmakers devoted to reversing years of deficit spending brought on by tax cuts and increased entitlement spending.        \n But the reality of sequestration, which set significant spending caps, combined with the ban on earmarks â€” once used to grease the wheels of legislation â€” have combined to make even historically bipartisan measures like the farm bill fraught with discord. â€œSequestration is a meat cleaver,â€ Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Thursday on the Senate floor.        \n Money, at the end of the day â€” when available â€” remains the great unifier.        \n To wit: a bipartisan immigration bill was possible in the Senate in large part because of billions of dollars in border-control spending, both for agents and equipment, that was added to it to appease conservatives, as well as a jobs program that secured support from some of the chamberâ€™s most liberal members. A measure to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy was similarly loaded with aid to states that suffered previous disasters.        \n Even the Appropriations Committee, while still the place of civility, shows the strains of the pinch.        \n In the Senate committee Thursday, members lamented an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have given more money to a program that would supplement heating and cooling costs for low-income people, but that, in this new era of tight purse strings, would pay for it by cutting into education grant money, as a â€œHobsonâ€™s choice.â€        \n Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, angrily criticized the choice, which she said made her stomach hurt, setting off one of the few unpleasant exchanges of the day among a group of senators.        \n â€œThe essence of what we are now discussing is the choice between helping poor families to stay warm or to send our kids to college,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s sad.â€        \n The measure passed, but the debate over whether paying for one groupâ€™s needs at the expense of anotherâ€™s is, Ms. Mikulski warned, â€œa much larger issue that canâ€™t be resolved by the debate here today. This is really kind of where we are.â€        \n                  \n  \t\t\t\t     A version of this article appeared in print on July 13, 2013, on page A 12 of the New York edition with the headline: A Day of Friction Notable Even for a Fractious Congress."
